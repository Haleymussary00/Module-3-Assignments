    "## Homework 01: First Steps with Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework will introduce you to foundational techniques in downloading and setting up datasets, running `sklearn` models, and examining their results. The primary goal is to establish the workflow for accessing and submitting assignments, writing basic code, and interpreting outputs. This assignment will also help us test the autograder and ensure that feedback mechanisms work seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Instructions via Gradescope\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Gradescope for homework submissions this term. Please follow these instructions carefully:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Do not make any changes to the cells containing the grading code**, e.g.,\n",
    "```python\n",
    "            # Graded Answer\n",
    "            # DO NOT change this cell in any way          \n",
    "\n",
    "            print(f'a1 = ${a1:,}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Verify before submission**  \n",
    "   - Before submitting, run `Restart Kernel and Run All` to ensure that all cells execute without errors. We do **not** run your notebook before grading it. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Submitting to Gradescope**  \n",
    "   - You should have received an email inviting you to join Gradescope. If not, please contact us immediately.  \n",
    "   - Log in to [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com), navigate to your dashboard, and locate **Homework 01**.  \n",
    "   - Drag and drop your file into the upload section, e.g., **`Homework_01.ipynb`**\n",
    "   - Click `Upload` to submit your file.\n",
    "   - You may submit your homework any number of times, but the date and time used for assessing late points will be the last submission. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Review your submission**  \n",
    "   - You will receive a confirmation email after submission. \n",
    "   - For the first two homeworks, you will get grading results immediately (and may resubmit to fix any errors)\n",
    "   - Starting with HW 03, you will get grading results after the late period has expired on Saturday morning.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. **Late penalty**\n",
    "    - For the first two homeworks, **no late penalty** will be applied.\n",
    "    - Starting with HW 03, you will be subject to a 10% penalty for each day late.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "6. **Review your grade**\n",
    "    - Starting with HW 03, you will receive the autograder results on Saturday morning after the last late deadline has passed; we will also upload a solution sheet to the Github repo where you download the homeworks.\n",
    " We do not distribute full solutions.\n",
    "    - If you believe there is a problem with your grades, you may submit a **regrade request** on Gradescope. Please be specific. Requests such as \"Please regrade the entire assignment\" will result in our repeating the previous sentence. Regrade requests must be made within two weeks of receiving your grade. "
